# 🗂️ Task Management System (Legacy to Modern MVC Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the transformation of a legacy ASP.NET MVC 5 application into a modern ASP.NET Core MVC architecture using microservices. It serves as a portfolio piece to showcase skills in software modernization, API development, and microservice architecture.

## 🏗️ Legacy App Features (ASP.NET MVC 5)

- User registration and login
- Role-based access (Admin/User)
- Task creation, editing, deletion
- Assign tasks to users
- Basic reporting (tasks by user/status)
- Razor views with Bootstrap styling
- Entity Framework 6 for data access

- Implement microservices:
  - `AuthService`: Authentication and user management
  - `OrderService`: Task management and assignment
  - `ReportingService`: Task analytics and reporting
- Use Entity Framework Core
- Add RESTful APIs
- Optional: Docker support and cloud deployment
