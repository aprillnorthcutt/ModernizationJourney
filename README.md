# ModernizationJourney

## Overview

**ModernizationJourney** is a professional portfolio project that demonstrates the transformation of a legacy monolithic application into modern architectures using microservices and updated MVC patterns. This project showcases best practices in software modernization, DevOps, and infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following subfolders:

- `LegacyMvcApp/`: Represents the original monolithic MVC application.
- `MicroservicesApp/`: Contains the re-architected version using microservices.
- `ModernMvcApp/`: Features a modernized MVC application with updated frameworks and design patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Framework / .NET Core** for application development
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **GitHub Actions** and **Azure Pipelines** for CI/CD
- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub** and **Azure DevOps** for repository and pipeline management

## Future Improvements

- Implement automated testing using xUnit or NUnit
- Add monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor or ELK stack
- Expand Terraform modules for scalable cloud infrastructure
- Integrate security scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines
- Document architecture decisions and diagrams
